I bought this computer from a guy who makes gaming computers and it's started to restart on its own over the past month, and it's at the point where I can't get to the desktop before it restarts again. I've tried all sorts of trouble shooting but nothing works, and I want to know if there could be physical problem with it. I'm not really smart when it comes to computer parts, and I don't really know where is begin with that kind of research. Below are the specs for the computer Hi, I have a Firegl T2 128MB on a laptop. It should be supported on linux (it's like a radeon 9600) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver#Fully\_supported (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver#Fully_supported) but instead everything is super choppy. Now it could be that my expectations are too high - or it may be that I've not configured properly. I've tried debian lxde, mint 19 xfce, xubuntu 18.04 and a bunch of others. Scrolling web pages is painful in linux, while Hello everyone, Need some advanced insight on this problem. Today I went to "fix" and older PC. It's an Athlon/ATI Radeon 9600 old PC. Apart from general stuff, motherboard's network slot was damaged during storm, power outbreak. Let me explain the steps I took and the issue that remains. It needed dust cleaning, I've put a new HDD inside cause old one make weird noises. They said it worked well enough for them with windows 7 and they had original key so I just fresh installed

I am hoping someone could help me, possibly anyone who has similar system specifications. I have been able to play this game on Maximum graphics up until about 3 weeks ago. I started noticing my FPS dropping to a horrendous 22-24. While driving or flying in a vehicle, things would start to disappear. Buildings, Mountains, Roads, Entire areas of the map.

This is something I mostly gave up on because I found an easy work around, but I'll get to that in a moment. At some point I noticed I was having really poor performance in FFXIV and many other games but I couldn't quite pin down why it was happening. Though eventually I noticed it was directly related to whether I was on my first boot of the day. This problem happens to such a ridiculous extent that I can simply reset my machine the second it gets to the Windows login screen and have perfect.

I am a Windows-user ever since and very much new to Linux. I tried installing EOS on my system and it worked well. The one thing I worry about is its sluggish/delay response to applications. My question: Does my current system support EOS? I don't know if I am doing it right. I am very much needing assistance at the moment.

Hello, a little over 2 1/2 years ago, I built a PC. It has an Intel i5-4690K processor at 3.5GHz and an AMD Radeon R9 200 Series GPU. The main driver is aticfx64.dll, version 21.19.407.0. It's running the 64 bit version of Windows 8.1 (6.3, Build 9600). I recently graduated from college and moved back home, moving my set-up back with me. After putting it back together, it's begun having a consistent issue in that at times, the display will cut out and then reappear several times except 
Hey guys, I've already opened an official ticket with Frontier regarding my issue, but I thought I'd get your opinions as well. This happens whenever something intense is happening on screen, whether it's a big fight or even during docking at a large station. My system isn't a powerhouse (as you can see), but I've never had any problems playing Battlefield 4, or other medium/high-intensity games. This problem is unique to Elite. Regardless, I don't actually drop any frames or lose responsivenes. I am looking to improve my current setup/situation. Below is what I have. Let me preface that I don't know much about computers, especially compared to you, so any help is welcomed. I am looking to save money by switching out parts instead of starting out completely. It may be best to build a new pc from scratch though. Don't ask as I didn't buy my current, it was a gift. Ideas of what I should change out right now or next steps. My budget would be around 0-0.

Its a 500$ "gaming" DESKTOP PC but it doesn't run games on very high graphics at all without super low FPS. I'm not a particularly adept person when it comes to hardware or anything like that. Was wondering if you guys could give me some advice in terms of upgrading it, if that's even possible. I understand if I'm in the wrong sub for this, I just have no idea where to start. The brand is "cybertron" and the model is called "x-strike" My specs are: Processor AMD A4-6300 APU with Radeon(tm). 
I recently took my laptop with me on vacation but ever since I got back I’ve had limited wireless connectivity, whereas my other devices reconnected automatically. Now, the network troubleshooter says “’Wi-Fi’ doesn’t have a valid ip configuration.” I’ve read dozens of “solved” replies to this sort of problem, which often had simple fixes I already tried, and I’ve spent countless hours trying to figure it out. I’ve called my service provider and they ran me through some of these I'm at a loss here. I've googled and everything, so I'm going to start posting this thread in as many places as possible until I get a solution. I JUST built a freakin' PC. 3 weeks ago. At first, it seemed fine. Now I'm getting FPS drops in CS:GO despite my computer being able to handle it. Here is the build: Windows 8.1 64 bit (6.3, Build 9600) AMD Athlon X4 860k Quad Core Processor 8192 MB of RAM AMD Radeon R9 200 Series Here is the post I made on /r/PCMasterRace: http://www.np.reddit. Hi guys. I was wondering if I can get some help here. My laptop became too weak to run newer games, and I think it's mainly due to its processor. Below are its specifications, and I'd appreciate if someone could link me to a new processor that's compatible with this laptop. Thanks in advance!
